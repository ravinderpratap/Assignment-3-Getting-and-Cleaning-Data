# Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Dataset
# Human Physical Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
# Files present
# CodeBook.md is a code book containing the description of all variables , the data, and  transformations I performed to gather and clean up the data
# run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
# 1. Merges the Train and test datasets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# Mean_on_subject_n_activity.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
